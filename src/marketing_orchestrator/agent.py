"""
This module defines the root agent for the entire multi-agent system.
It uses a SequentialAgent architecture, which means it runs a series of sub-agents
one after another, passing the combined results from one step to the next.

This sequential process ensures a logical workflow:
1. Research is conducted.
2. Insights are gathered.
3. Offers are designed based on the collected information.
