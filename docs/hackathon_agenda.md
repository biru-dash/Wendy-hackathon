## ðŸ“Š Level 1: Core Agents (10:40 - 11:20 AM)

### Goal
Learn how agents work by improving two core agents through instruction tuning.

### Task 1: Customer Insights Agent (20 min)

**What it does**: Analyzes customer data from BigQuery datasets

**Your mission**: Improve the insights by modifying instructions

**Steps**:
1. Open `customer_insights/root_agent_instruction.txt`
2. Test baseline: "What are dining preferences of Gen-Z customers?"
3. Modify instructions to be more specific:
   - Add demographic focus (age groups, regions)
   - Request quantitative metrics
   - Specify output format (bullet points, tables)
4. Re-run and compare results

**Example Enhancement**:
```
Add to instructions: "Always include percentage metrics, compare across age groups, 
and highlight actionable insights for QSR marketing campaigns."
```

### Task 2: Market Trends Analyst (20 min)

**What it does**: Uses Google Search to find market trends and industry insights

**Your mission**: Make it more relevant for Wendy's

**Steps**:
1. Open `market_trends_analyst/root_agent_instruction.txt`
2. Test baseline: "What are emerging food trends in QSR?"
3. Modify instructions to:
   - Focus on specific topics (plant-based, delivery, social media)
   - Prioritize recent trends (last 3 months)
   - Request competitive comparisons
4. Re-run and compare results

**Example Enhancement**:
```
Add to instructions: "Focus on trends relevant to quick-service restaurants. 
Prioritize social media trends and competitor innovations from the past quarter."
```

### Success Criteria
- âœ… More specific, actionable outputs
- âœ… Better data/metrics included
- âœ… Outputs align with Wendy's needs
- âœ… Faster, more focused results

## ðŸš€ Level 2: Advanced (11:20 - 11:50 AM)

### Goal
For teams who finish Level 1 early - add competitive intelligence and multi-agent workflows.

### Task 3: Competitor Intelligence (15 min)

**What it does**: Monitors and analyzes competitor strategies using web search and synthesis

**Your mission**: Configure it to track specific competitors

**Steps**:
1. Open `competitor_intelligence/root_agent_instruction.txt`
2. Add specific competitors: McDonald's, Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Taco Bell
3. Test: "What promotional strategies are competitors using this quarter?"
4. Modify to focus on:
   - Pricing strategies
   - Menu innovations
   - Digital/delivery initiatives
   - Social media campaigns

**Example Enhancement**:
```
Add to instructions: "Focus on McDonald's, Burger King, and Chick-fil-A. 
Prioritize pricing, limited-time offers, and digital ordering innovations. 
Provide actionable competitive insights with specific examples."
```

### Task 4: Multi-Agent Integration (15 min)

**Your mission**: Chain agents together for comprehensive insights

**Ideas**:
- Run Market Trends â†’ then feed insights to Customer Insights
- Run Customer Insights + Competitor Intelligence â†’ identify gaps
- Create a "Campaign Brief" using multiple agent outputs

**Steps**:
1. Run Customer Insights: "What do Gen-Z customers want?"
2. Run Competitor Intelligence: "What are competitors offering to Gen-Z?"
3. Run Market Trends: "What Gen-Z food trends are emerging?"
4. Synthesize results into one recommendation

### Bonus Challenges
- Add custom tools to `tools/agent_tools.py`
- Optimize BigQuery queries in `customer_insights/data/`
- Create chain-of-thought prompts in instructions
- Add few-shot examples to improve accuracy
