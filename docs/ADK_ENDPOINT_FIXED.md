# ‚úÖ ADK Endpoint Fixed!

## Good News

Your test confirmed the correct endpoint format:
```
http://localhost:8000/apps/marketing_orchestrator/users/{user_id}/sessions/{session_id}
```

## Important Discovery

The ADK API processes **asynchronously**. When you POST to create a session, the response shows:
```json
{"events": []}
```

This means:
1. ‚úÖ The POST creates the session successfully (returns 200)
2. ‚è≥ The agent execution happens asynchronously
3. üìä You need to **poll the session** with GET requests to get the events

## How the Updated Code Works

The `hackathon_ui.py` now:

1. **POSTs to create session** - Initial request creates the session
2. **Detects empty events** - Checks if `events: []` in response
3. **Polls for results** - Makes GET requests every 2 seconds for up to 60 seconds
4. **Processes events** - Once events arrive, extracts and displays the results

## Testing the Fix

1. **Make sure ADK server is running:**
   ```powershell
   adk api_server marketing_orchestrator
   ```

2. **Run Streamlit UI:**
   ```powershell
   streamlit run hackathon_ui.py
   ```

3. **Test with a query** in the UI - it should now:
   - Connect successfully (no 404 error)
   - Poll for agent results
   - Display offer concepts when ready

## Expected Behavior

- **Initial POST**: Returns 200 with `events: []`
- **Polling**: GET requests every 2 seconds
- **Events arrive**: Once agents finish, events populate
- **Display results**: UI extracts offer concepts and displays them

## Troubleshooting

### If events never arrive:
- Check ADK server logs for errors
- Verify agents are configured correctly
- Increase polling timeout in code (currently 60 seconds)

### If you see "Agent processing timeout":
- Agents might be taking longer than expected
- Try a simpler query
- Check ADK server terminal for progress

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Endpoint format confirmed
2. ‚úÖ Polling logic added
3. ‚úÖ Error handling improved
4. üß™ **Test the full flow**: Run Streamlit and try a query!

The UI should now work end-to-end! üéâ
